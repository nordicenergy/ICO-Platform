# Coindash - ICO/STO Platform


The Coindash ICO (Initial Coin Offering) Platform by BitFinance allows you to run a secure and flexible web-based application that enables buyers to purchase your tokens before the point of initial allocation. The platform has been built from the ground up using C# and the .NET Core.

ICO Platform enables buyers to earn a proportion of your tokens by making contributions in either BTC, BFN, STRAT or Coindash. However, Changelly is also integrated into the ICO Platform, and buyers can use this service to convert fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies into Coindash seamlessly.


#### In addition, the platform is KYC (Know Your Customer) ready and currently supports Onfido integration.

The BitFinance Initial Coin Offering Platform (Coindash) allows you to run a secure and flexible web-based application that enables buyers to purchase your tokens before the point of initial allocation.

For more information on the workflow and the components involved with the ICO/STO Platform, please refer to the ICO/STO Platform Overview document.

#### Features of the ICO/STO Platform include:

- A highly customizable design, which enables you to ensure the ICO site conforms with your unique branding.

- The ability to accept funds in USD, BTC, COINDASH and 50+ additional cryptocurrencies via Changelly, a service that enables ICO/STO contributors to pay in many digital currencies.

- Integration with Onfido’s ‘Know-Your-Customer’ (KYC) service that screens contributors against anti-money laundering watch-lists and undertakes document checks.

- IPStack integration allowing you to block citizens in selected countries from registering, in addition, the service is also able to detect Tor Traffic and VPN's.
